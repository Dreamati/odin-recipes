    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My mom's 7-layer dip is a big hit at all small gatherings! Refried beans are layered with guacamole, taco-seasoned sour cream, veggies, and cheese; it's perfect for dipping tortilla chips. The dip traditionally takes less time to disappear into bellies than it does to prepare.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avadacado</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>¼ cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash avocados in a medium bowl to desired consistency. Mix in cilantro, salsa, lime juice, garlic salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Blend sour cream and taco seasoning in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread refried beans in a 9x13-inch dish or on a large serving platter. Top with sour cream mixture; cover with guacamole. Top with tomatoes, green onions, Mexican-style cheese blend, and black olives.</li>
    </ol>
